# Broad Interests
I am broadly interested in studying the evolution and genetics of plant adaptations, especially with respect to domestication. Particularly, I am interested in identifying plant adaptive traits, and what selective forces drives these adaptations. I am also passionate about working towards dissecting the underlying molecular mechanisms that lead to the adaptation and facilitates plant evolution -- How do plants adapt to the different environments, and evolve?

# Ongoing Projects
## Leaf shape diversity in sweetpotato
Leaf shape, a spectacularly diverse plant trait, varies across taxonomic levels, geography and in response to environmental differences. However, comprehensive intraspecific analyses of leaf shape variation across variable environments is surprisingly absent. We performed a multilevel analysis of leaf shape using diverse accessions of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), and uncovered that although commonly used leaf traits, like leaf circularity and length-to-breadth ratio, is controlled mainly by genetics, leaf shape as a complex trait is also significantly altered by the environment, and GÃ—E. 
Additionally, we found that leaf shape is correlated with yield in sweetpotato. Now, through a multi-garden field study, we are also studying the relationship between leaf shape, the physiology of the plant and yield characteristics.
